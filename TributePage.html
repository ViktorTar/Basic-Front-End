							<h3>Claud Shannon's life time line: </h3>
							<ul>
								<li><b>1916</b> - born in Petoskey, Michigan</li>
								<li><b>1932</b> - graduated from Gaylord High School entered the University of Michigan, where he took a course that introduced him to the work of George Boole</li>
								<li><b>1936</b> - graduated with two bachelor's degrees, in electrical engineering and mathematics,  began his graduate studies in electrical engineering at MIT</li>
								<li><b>1937</b> - wrote his master's degree thesis, "A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits"</li>
								<li><b>1940</b> - received his Ph.D. degree from MIT, became a National Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey</li>
								<li><b>1942</b> - Shannon is credited with the invention of signal-flow graphs</li>
								<li><b>1943</b> - came into contact with the leading British mathematician Alan Turing.</li>
								<li><b>1945</b> - as the war was coming to an end, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on fire control a special essay titled Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems, coauthored by Shannon, Ralph Beebe Blackman, and Hendrik Wade Bode, formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire-control by analogy with "the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems."</li>
								<li><b>1948</b> - "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the Bell System Technical Journal</li>
								<li><b>1949</b> - proved that the cryptographic one-time pad is unbreakable in his classified research</li>
								<li><b>1956</b> - joined the MIT faculty to work in the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE)</li>
								<li><b>2001</b> - died at the age of 84</li>
